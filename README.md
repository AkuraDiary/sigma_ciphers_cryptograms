# ciphers-cryptograms 🥖

Yes, this was a DIY cipher inplementation inspired from gravity falls with python, but now, i've added my custom algorithm called Sigma (if you had a name suggestion, contact me please) so, what is Sigma ? simply it's the algorithm that stacked data from another simple ciphers algorithm

## Algorithm or ciphers list 🍞

> - Caesar -> good old Caesar ciphers, with 3 shift parameter
> - Atbash -> Reversing the letter
> - ABZA -> A into B Z into A
> - AN -> classic scout cipher, A into N and N into A (turns out, this is a Caesar ciphers with 13 shift parameter)
> - A1Z26 -> A into 1 Z into 26 (this algorithm still need some adjustment to implement into Sigma)
> 
> // if you had another classic algorithm or custom algorithm that you want to add into this project, you can contribute [here]() or contact me
> 
> - Sigma -> Wrapper algorithm / my custom algorithm

## Use Case ? 🥪
### - encrypting your private file
### - encrypting another people file (wait, that's illegal, or is it 🤨)
### - doing some encrypted message with your friend, or on exams 🤨

## How it works (Sigma in Action)
> in a nutshell, it works by generating a token, and encrypt the text / data from that token char by char, and the length of the token is adjustable

Testing it :

```
 py Sigma.py
 
 output :

testing with file
Token: %#c%Ad$d
File :  dummy-file.txt
